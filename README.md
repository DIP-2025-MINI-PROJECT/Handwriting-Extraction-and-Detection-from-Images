# Handwriting-Extraction-and-Detection-from-Images
This project focuses on extracting handwritten text from images using a step-by-step image-processing pipeline in MATLAB. The system uses grayscale conversion, filtering, thresholding, and morphological operations to isolate and segment handwritten characters, even when the image has noise, poor lighting, or uneven handwriting. The extracted characters are currently sent to Tesseract for basic text recognition. In the next stage, we will integrate a trained deep-learning model to improve accuracy and make the handwriting recognition more reliable.
